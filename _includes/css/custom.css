/* Fix Timeline/Team Section Overlap on Mobile */

    /* The final item in the timeline often has zero bottom margin,
     *   which causes the overlap on mobile. We add margin back to create space.
     */

        margin-bottom: 40px !important;

    /* Alternatively, add padding above the next section heading
     *   (assuming the team section has the ID #team or is the next section)
     */

    /* If the text itself is too wide, apply a wrapper fix:
     *   body {
     *       overflow-x: hidden;
}
This is already in agency.css, but sometimes needs checking.
